Scrape website data using the scrapy python library

This library can be modified and utilized to produce even more meaningful reports on the current state of the market
including but not limited to:

1. List of the best exchanges for arbitrage
2. Listing the highest volume exchanges for a specific pair (currently only shows BTC/USD)
3. Highest percentage of order completion across the viable exchanges

Currently, the "run_marketcap_report" just lists the top 30 exchanges in terms of 24h volume against the BTC/USD pair
There is more that can be done with the data and other reports we can generate off the coinmarketcap.com website or
other websites that report on the state of cryptocurrency
